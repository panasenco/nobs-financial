## Intro

When most people think of life insurance, they think of a way to provide for their family if they happen to die and the family loses a major source of income or care.
However, at a certain level of wealth this stops being a problem.
If a person has something like $5M in assets or more, they know their family will not end up destitute.
At that level of wealth, it becomes more about ensuring particular desirable outcomes than about preventing undesirable ones.
Banks and insurance companies will try to target wealthy individuals directly or through financial planners with creative investment solutions that promise risk-free riches.
These investment solutions are not scams, but you probably don't need them.

## Fixed annuities

### U.S. Treasury Bonds
Suppose you want an annuity that's as risk-free as possible.
That exists and is called [U.S. Treasury Bonds](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/marketable-securities/treasury-bonds/).
As of the time of this writing (Nov 2024), treasury bonds earn a 4.5% on your money every year.
The U.S. treasury has been around longer than whatever financial institution is trying to sell you a fixed rate annuity.
The U.S. treasury has never defaulted on its bonds in its entire history.
Unlike your financial institution, the U.S. treasury can literally print money to pay you back.
If your U.S. treasury bonds default, your diversification strategy should include ammo and canned water.

### But my financial institution promises a higher rate!

Are you sure about that?
Is that the amount you're actually going to get in your bank account after all is said and done?
I promise that the actual payout you're going to get after everyone takes their cut will be equivalent to treasury bonds.

### But I want more!

Then do what the insurance company does and buy a diverse variety of investment-grade bonds.
Expect that a fraction of them will default.
Most of the time, the default rate will be less than 5%, but extreme market crashes can bring it to 10% or even higher.
The highest bond default rate ever recorded was [16% in the 1870s](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w15848/w15848.pdf).
Of course, the default rate of bonds that appeal to you specifically could be even higher.
It's safest to buy an index fund like [BND](https://etfdb.com/etf/BND) that invests into all investment-grade bonds.

### But I want even more than an index fund!

See [Warren Buffett's Bet With Hedge Funds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030916/buffetts-bet-hedge-funds-year-eight-brka-brkb.asp).
Not even some of the smartest people in the world with access to virtually unlimited resources could outperform an index fund.
It wasn't even close!
Financial planners and institutions will try to convince you that they have the secret formula to beat the market, but they don't care if it succeeds or not - they'll get their commission no matter what.
Don't be a sucker.
If you want more money than what an index fund can make you, get a job and earn some.

## Variable annuities

The sales pitch here is "participate in the market's upsides, don't lose any money if the market downturns".
You can easily do this yourself.
All you have to do is make risky gambles with your bond interest.

### Mathematical example
Suppose you've purchased $10,000 of treasury bonds, and suppose they earn 5%.
Use an additional $500 (5% of $10,000) to buy a one-year at-the-money call option on the S&P 500.
At the end of the year, the treasury bonds will pay you $500, so you haven't lost any money.
If the S&P 500 falls, your option expires worthless, so you don't get anything.
If the S&P 500 rises, you get the amount of the rise.
If the price of the S&P 500 is $6,000, that's 60% of the $10,000 you had originally invested.
That means you'll make roughly 60% of the S&P 500 rise if it rises and lose absolutely nothing if it falls.

### Risk-free investment
Any way you invest the interest you get from your risk-free treasury bonds is technically a risk-free investment.
You can use it to buy options or even gamble in Vegas.
Your principal will be completely unaffected.

## Even more possibilities
There are lots of ways financial planners will try to create a very custom product for affluent investors.
Just like the variable annuities example above, these products are nothing special.
If you really need them, these days, you can buy pretty much everything you could desire as ETFs.

For example, if you want something exotic like options overlays, you can purchase [option overlay ETFs](https://www.vestfin.com/etfs).

## Conclusion

Lots of people make their living by selling the rich things they don't need, and financial planners and financial institutions make quite a bit from it.
If you're rich, you can probably achieve anything a financial planner/advisor/manager might want to sell you with your own brokerage account.
