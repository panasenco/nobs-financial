## The story so far

Growing up, I've heard many adults in my life as well as strangers on the Internet talk authoritatively about the stock market, the economy, and how to make money.
I suspected they were full of it, but didn't have a way to prove it, so I decided to study up.

In 2018, I graduated with a Financial Actuarial Mathematics degree from UCLA.
Summary of what I learned in my degree: Most of the financial advice you hear comes from people either trying to profit off you or suckers parroting it to others. Financial math is very simple at its core, and the people who make it complicated are trying to get their money from you, not from the market.

I've worked as a computer engineer since graduating, not really using my degree at all.
Recently my interest in financial products has been rekindled.
I'll take notes on financial products I encounter here and cut through the BS for you.

## The goal: An open-source AI financial chatbot

Financial advisors and planners make money by selling you things you don't necessarily need.
They have a vested interest in not letting you take charge of your own financial future.

However, an open-source AI need not have such limitations.
It could look out for your interests alone and give you the best no-BS options for your financial goals.
Even if this site/organization deviates from these goals, the AI could just be forked by the community.

You can find the source code for this project at [github.com/panasenco/nobs-financial](https://github.com/panasenco/nobs-financial).
For now it's just a Jekyll site.
