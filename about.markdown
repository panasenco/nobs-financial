## The story so far

Hi, my name is Aram Panasenco.
Growing up, I've heard many adults in my life as well as strangers on the Internet talk authoritatively about the stock market, the economy, and how to make money.
I suspected they were full of it, but didn't have a way to prove it, so I decided to study up.

In 2018, I graduated with a Financial Actuarial Mathematics degree from UCLA.
Summary of what I learned in my degree: Most of the financial advice you hear comes from people either trying to profit off you or suckers parroting it to others. Financial math is very simple at its core, and the people who make it complicated are trying to make you into a sucker.

I've worked as a computer engineer since graduating, not really using my degree at all.
Recently my interest in financial products has been rekindled.
I'll take notes on financial products I encounter here and cut through the BS for you.

## The goal: An open-source AI financial advisor that looks out for your interests

Financial advisors and financial planners make money by selling you things you don't necessarily need.
They have a vested interest in not letting you take charge of your own financial future.

However, an open-source AI need not have such limitations.
It could look out for your interests alone and give you the best no-BS options for your financial goals.
Even if the AI somehow becomes corrupted, it could just be forked by the community.

For now it's just a Jekyll site.
